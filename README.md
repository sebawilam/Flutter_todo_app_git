# todo_app

To do aplication using LiteSQL

## Getting Started

This project is my starting point for a Flutter application.

The app is done based on above and now available in [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartherd.todo_app). This is TO DO type application. You can make a note containing Title, Deadline and Description. The main screen displays all notes/to do tasks. The notes are order by importance (High/Low) and deadline. In front of every note there is icon. The color depends on type of the note. If the note is High the icon color is red. If the note is Low but deadline is today or passed the icon color is orange. The Low note with future deadline has a yellow icon color. The application if fully offline. You don't need internet access to use it. Your data are kept only in your device and not copied to any external services. This application is written in Flutter, based on Smartherd course and uses some source codes from the Flutter Tutorial for Beginners with Dart.
